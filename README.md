# Don't Hangme

## Introduction

Don't Hangme is based on the classic Hangman game. In this version, the program randomly selects a word from a list of almost one thousand words for the player to try and figure out. You don't need an opponent to challenge you, this is a single player game, but you can team up with other people to try and guess the answer. The idea is to have a game that is quick, challenging and can be played over and over again. It was made using Python to be played in a terminal. The game is deployed via Heroku and through Code Institute's template, a mock terminal is generated on a web page making it playable in a browser.

## UX

### Strategy

#### Target Audience
* All ages
* All levels
* English speakers
* English students

#### User Stories
* I want to know how to play the game
* I want to see my progress
* I want to be able to replay many times consecutively

#### Site Objectives
* Provide a game that runs smoothly
* Provide quick yet challenging entertainment
* Provide an easy to use interface

### Scope

Based on the objectives and user stories.

#### Requirements
* Engaging yet easy to understand instructions
* Consistent playthrough, no need to reload page or game
* New word every with every new start

### Structure

The game is run via a mock terminal on a web page. It is constrained to that environment. It's deployed through Heroku which is connected to GitHub.

The user only needs to give single character inputs followed by the Enter key.

### Skeleton

The intention was always to create a game where the player wouldn't have to leave the terminal environment to keep playing as many rounds as they want. They shouldn't have to even touch their mouse.

In order to better visualize and plan the game cycle, I developed a flow chart to organize the functions and keep them in logical order. This way I could see where the game might run into a wall and programmed accordingly in order to keep it flowing.

Here is the logic flow for Don't Hangme:

### Surface

Considering that the objective of this project was to make a Python program to be run via terminal, no HTML or CSS (aside from the basic provided by the Code Institute template) was used. All of the graphic design is in-game in the form of ASCII Art, it is visible in the stylized way the title, win and fail messages are written as well as the gallows and the man.
